1) At which state of the project are you ? 

-> Proceed with literature review 

2) What is done in detail ? 

In the time of 4 weeks I have built up a basic understanding of functional near-infrared spectroscopy. After choosing the appropriate search strategy for "bad channels" I started to examine the first articles and got an understanding for a structured examination of articles. The exact definition of "bad channel" was understood and I was able to use it as an object of investigation. At the same time I try to get an idea of the structure of a paper and write my own abstract afterwods. Based on this I took a look at how Overleaf works.  

3) Summerice your learnings  

Functional infrared spectroscopy is an imaging technique which can infer the activity of brain regions based on the concentration of HBO and HBR. This optical method is robutster against artifacts, but has a low penetration depth of max 1 to 2cm. Based on the optical method, the signal strength is very low and a minimal disturbance such as pigmentation can lead to strong artifacts. Channels which show a lot of artifacts are defined as "bad channels" and have to be characterized to exclude them.  For example, a channel can be defined as "bad" based on the presence of cardiac fluctuations.
